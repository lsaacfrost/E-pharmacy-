_Project Overview_

- Project Name: E-Pharmacy
- Project Description: E-Pharmacy is an online platform connecting patients with health centers for medication prescriptions and purchases, utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) for enhanced user experience and improved healthcare outcomes.

_Functional Components_

1. Disease Diagnosis (AI-powered)
    - Symptom Checker: Patients input symptoms, and AI algorithms analyze data to identify potential diseases.
    - Disease Database: Comprehensive database of diseases, symptoms, and treatment options.
2. E-Pharmacy
    - Medication Database: Comprehensive database of medications, including dosage, side effects, and interactions.
    - Personalized Recommendations: AI-generated medication suggestions based on diagnosis and patient medical history.
    - Online Pharmacy: Patients can purchase medications online, with options for delivery or pickup.
3. Health Center Network
    - Health Center Database: Comprehensive database of top-rated health centers, including specialties, locations, and patient reviews.
    - AI-Powered Matching: Patients are matched with optimal health centers based on diagnosis, location, and treatment needs.
    - Appointment Scheduling: Patients can schedule appointments online.

_Use Case Diagrams_

_Patient Use Cases:_

1. Register/Log in
2. Input symptoms for disease diagnosis
3. View diagnosis and treatment options
4. Purchase medication online
5. Find and schedule appointments with health centers
6. View patient dashboard (medical history, appointments, medication list)

_Health Center Use Cases:_

1. Register/Log in
2. View patient profiles and medical history
3. Receive patient appointment requests
4. Manage health center profile and availability
5. View patient reviews and ratings

_AI Use Cases:_

1. Analyze patient symptoms for disease diagnosis
2. Generate personalized medication recommendations
3. Match patients with optimal health centers
